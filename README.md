# Optical Manipulation of Macroscopic Objects with Holographic Light

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Python simulation project exploring the feasibility of using holographic light techniques to manipulate macroscopic objects. Inspired by optical trapping methods used for microscopic particles, the project investigates the application of Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs) to generate holographic patterns capable of manipulating larger masses. The simulation explores the challenges and potential advancements required for scaling optical manipulation techniques from the microscopic to macroscopic scale with using specifically an apple. 

This is the continuation from my paper, "Is it Theoretically Possible to Move Macroscopic Objects With an Optical Holographic Light?"


## Abstract

Studies have explored the potential of using light to manipulate microscopic entities, and this paper investigates the feasibility of extending these techniques to macroscopic objects using holographic methods. Optical trapping of microscopic objects has successfully utilized Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs) to create holographic patterns necessary for optical tweezers. While optical tweezers have proven effective for trapping microscopic particles with light patterns, real-time hologram computation, particularly for moving macroscopic objects, requires algorithms such as the Fourier Transform.

The energy and intensity demands for manipulating larger masses pose significant challenges, necessitating further technological advancements to become feasible. Nevertheless, this study concludes that future advancements in large-scale optical tweezers for macroscopic manipulation are promising due to foundational work in manipulating microscopic entities with light.
